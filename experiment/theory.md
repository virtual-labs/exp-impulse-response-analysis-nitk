### Theory

Impulse force can be defined as a force that has large magnitude and acts for a short time. It can be measured by finding the change it causes in the momentum of system.
<br> <center>Impulse = F&delta;T = m $\dot x$<sub>2</sub> - m $\dot x$<sub>1</sub> </center>

The initial conditions are given by<center>

x(t=0) = x<sub>0</sub> = 0

$\dot x$(t=0) = $\dot x$<sub>0</sub> = 1/m

The displacement for the masses are calculated as,

<h3>The equation for the experiment is as follows</h3>

<p>the x1d and x2d is the initial velocity  assumption  which is 0 in this case</p>
