Given data:

k<sub>1</sub> - stiffness of mass 1 (N/m) <br>
m<sub>1</sub> - mass 1 (kg) <br>
k<sub>2</sub> - stiffness of mass 2 (N/m) <br>
m<sub>2</sub> - mass 2 (kg) <br>

For a constant value of impulse force, different responses can be observed by varying the masses m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> and stiffness k<sub>1</sub> and k<sub>2</sub>.
1. On clicking the simulation tab, the first page is displayed as shown below.

Here, the user can set k<sub>1</sub>, m<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>2</sub> and m<sub>2</sub>, which will vary the response of the system.

2. On clicking the next button, the mode shapes will be displayed, while the simulation is running.
